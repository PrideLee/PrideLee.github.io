**Summary**
- The difference between “vector space” and “probabilistic” IR systems is not that great. For a probabilistic IR system, it’s just that, at the end, you score queries not by cosine similarity and tf–idf in a vector space, but by a slightly different formula motivated by probability theory. Indeed, sometimes people have changed an existing vector-space IR system into an effectively probabilistic system simply by adopted term weighting formulas from probabilistic models. 
- The probabilistic approach to IR originated in the United Kingdom in the 1950s. The first major presentation of a probabilistic model is Maron and Kuhns (1960). Robertson and Jones (1976) introduce the main foundations of the BIM and van Rijsbergen (1979) presents in detail the classic BIM probabilistic model.
