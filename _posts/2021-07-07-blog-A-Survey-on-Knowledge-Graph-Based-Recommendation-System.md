**Conclusions**
- Knowledge graph theory was initiated by C. Hoede, a discrete mathematician at the University of Twente, and F.N. Stokman, a mathematical sociologist at the University of Groningen, in 1982.
- Embeddingbased methods leverage the semantic representation of users/items in the KG for the recommendation, while path-based methods use the semantic connectivity information.
- The unified method is based on the idea of embedding propagation. These methods refine the entity representation with the guidance of the connective structure in the KG.
- Path-based methods have been developed since 2013, and traditional papers call this type of method as a recommendation in the HIN.
