So as to shallow model of Sequence Tagging, HMM and CRF are the common methods, while for deep learning model, CRF+BiLSTM is a mature method. In this blog I will introduce above methodes. You can click [**here**](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/50184092) and [**here**](https://github.com/PrideLee/Machine-Learning-Notes/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/HMM_CRF) to see the full blog.
