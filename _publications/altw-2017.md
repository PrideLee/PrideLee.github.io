## Abstract
Answering questions while reasoning over multiple supporting facts has long been a goal of artificial intelligence. Recently, remarkable advances have been made, focusing on reasoning over natural language-based stories. In particular, end-to-end memory networks (N2N), have achieved state-of-the-art results over such tasks. However, N2Ns are limited by the necessity to choose between two weight tying schemes, neither of which performs consistently well over all tasks. We propose a unified model generalising weight tying and in doing so, make the model more expressive. The proposed model achieves uniformly high performance, improving on the best results for memory network-based models on the bAbI dataset, and competitive results on Dialog bAbI.
