## Abstract
This paper describes an experimental approach to Detection of Minimal Semantic Units and their Meaning (DiMSUM), explored within the framework of SemEvalâ€™16 Task 10. The approach is primarily based on a combination of word embeddings and parserbased features, and employs unidirectional incremental computation of compositional embeddings for multiword expressions.
