## Abstract
The invention provides a table recognition method and system, belonging to the technical field of table recognition, which utilizes nonlinear contrast enhancement based on weighted RC threshold iteration and Gaussian Laplacian LoG operator to carry out binarization processing on table images conforming to the format, and utilizes tilt correction algorithm based on perspective change to carry out tilt correction; uses an image morphological processing method to extract table box lines, segmentation of cells, to obtain the smallest cell; establishes the character database of the smallest cell, carries on the neural network training, establishes the form recognition model, carries on the recognition to the form. The invention has the advantages of simple calculation, fast speed, accurate identification of table images with weak contrast, uneven light and dark distribution of images and blurred background. The speed and precision of recognition are improved by establishing special high-frequency characters, training special neural network and template matching. At the same time, the customized neural network is simple in structure and reduces the time and workload of training and tuning.
