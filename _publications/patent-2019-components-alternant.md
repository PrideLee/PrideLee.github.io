## Abstract
The invention discloses an alternative selection system and alternative selection method for electronic components, belonging to the technical field of the electronic component alternative selection method. Attribute information of electronic components in an electronic component original database is collected, and attribute information is preprocessed to construct a substitution component database. The primary attributes, the secondary attributes and the distance calculation attributes of each replacement element in the replacement element database are determined; according to the main attributes, the secondary attributes and the distance calculation attributes, the comprehensive similarity between the replacement elements is calculated. According to the attribute information of the replaced element and the comprehensive similarity between the replaced elements, the replaced element is determined. The invention effectively reduces computational complexity and has higher efficiency byestablishing a component comprehensive similarity model to search for similar components. At that same time, the replacement scheme is updated iteratively according to the actual use experience of thereplacement component and the feedback information of the users, and the replacement result is proved to be more reliable than the existing technical scheme.
