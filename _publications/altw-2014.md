## Abstract
In this paper, we propose an automatic identification model, capable of extracting expressions of locations (EoLs) within Twitter messages. Moreover, we participated in the competition of ALTA Shared Task 2014 and our best-performing system is ranked among the top 3 systems (2nd in the public leaderboard). In our model, we explored the validity of the use of a wide variety of lexical, structural and geospatial features as well as a machine learning model Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Further, we investigated the effectiveness of stacking and self-training.
