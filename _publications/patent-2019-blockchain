## Abstract
The invention discloses an electronic component data management system based on block chains, and belongs to the technical field of communication system data management. The system comprises the account block chain used for storing user basic information and user relationship and authority information, the transaction block chain used for storing data operation information, a registration module used for performing system initialization and key generation, obtaining a registration application of a user, verifying an identity of the user and finishing registration of the user to enable the user to become a legal node of the system, and a data storage module used for attaching digital signatures and timestamps to electronic component data by a data provider and performing encrypted storagein the legal node. The block chains for storing the component data are deployed in an alliance chain mode, so that the storage space is saved; meanwhile, the application of a PBFT mechanism avoids large-scale calculation; and the integrity and traceability of all relevant data in the whole life cycle of electronic components are achieved, the production cost is reduced, and the development and production time of product equipment and the task progress of scientific research are shortened.
