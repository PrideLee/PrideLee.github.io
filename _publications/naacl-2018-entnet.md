## Abstract
While neural networks have been shown to achieve impressive results for sentence-level sentiment analysis, targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis (TABSA) — extraction of fine-grained opinion polarity w.r.t. a pre-defined set of aspects — remains a difficult task. Motivated by recent advances in memory-augmented models for machine reading, we propose a novel architecture, utilising external “memory chains” with a delayed memory update mechanism to track entities independently. Over the task of TABSA, the proposed model demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, including those using external knowledge bases.
