## Abstract

- Aerospace plastic packaging components are in high demand as reliability, and scanning acoustic microscope screening test is an effective tool to ensure them reability in space environment. I use image processing and machine learning technology to segment and recognize the failure ultrasonic image of plastic components.
- The data exist a sort of unbalance and cost sensitive problem, I introduce cost-sensitive learning. Calculating the integrated adjustment ratio to balance the sample distribution and making classifier sensitive. Based on YOLO-v3 network to classified the components, then according failure standards, I utilize image processing technology to extract features. Besides I also train and compare differen classifers accuracy.
- Relying on above research, I developed a failure recognition tool of plastic part acoustic scanning image to reduce the operating pressure and special knowledge requirements of technicians.
- Based on YOLO v3 network, component SAM image defect detection tool was developed.
